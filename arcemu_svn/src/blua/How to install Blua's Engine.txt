folder and make a new file called Blua
Check out this svn "http://svn.assembla.com/svn/Blua/Blua Engine"
then go into the folder open Blua2008, or Blua2005, or Blua2003
and Build Solution

if that doesn't work for some reason do this


go into your 
/..arcemu folder/src/scripts/src

you will see LUAScripting folder
delete that folder and make a new one with same exact name

rightclick->SVN Checkout "http://svn.assembla.com/svn/Blua/Blua Engine/src"
let it get the svn

then go back to
/..arcemu folder/src/scripts

and open Scripts2008 or 2005 or 2003 depending on which visual C++ version 
you have and then simply compile the project
